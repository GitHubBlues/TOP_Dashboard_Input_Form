## **TOP_Dashboard_Input_Form**

This repository shows the dashboard and the sign-in form, both assignments of the Intermediate HTML and CSS module of The Odin project. 

The task of the sign-in assignment was to replicate a form following the instructions provided [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/intermediate-html-and-css/lessons/sign-up-form).

The aim of the sign-in form was to practice: 
 - using different HTML input types (text, email, password),
 - adding labels to the inputs,
 - positioning with CSS (absolute, relative),
 - CSS units (vh,vw, px), 
 - styling of input boxes,
 - styling pseudo-classes (focus),
 - including downloaded fonts, 
 - using Emmet

The aim of the dashboard project was to practice: 
 - grid layout

The animations allowed practicing:
 - the css-transform properties (translation, rotation, scaling),
 - css-transitions,
 - css animations using @keyframes rules

The code was formatted with prettier and eslint was used for avoiding syntax errors.
