## **TOP HTML and CSS projects**

This repository shows the projects of the "Intermediate HTML and CSS" module and some animation inspired by the topics covered in the "Advanced HTML and CSS module". 

The task of the sign-in assignment was to replicate a form following the instructions provided [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/intermediate-html-and-css/lessons/sign-up-form). The aim of the sign-in form was to practice: 
 - using different HTML input types (text, email, password),
 - adding labels to the inputs,
 - positioning with CSS (absolute, relative),
 - CSS units (vh,vw, px), 
 - styling of input boxes,
 - styling pseudo-classes (focus),
 - including downloaded fonts, 
 - using Emmet

The specifications for the dashboard project are [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/intermediate-html-and-css/lessons/admin-dashboard). The main objective of this project was to practice: 
 - grid layout

The animations were carried our in the context of the advanced HTML and CSS module available [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/advanced-html-and-css). The animations implement:
 - css-transform properties (translation, rotation, scaling),
 - css-transitions,
 - css animations using @keyframes rules

The code was formatted with prettier and eslint was used for avoiding syntax errors.
