## **TOP_Dashboard_Input_Form**

This repository shows the dashboard and the sign-in form, both assignments of the Intermediate HTML and CSS module of the ODIN project. 

The aim of the sign-in form was to practice: 
 - using different HTML input types (text, email, password),
 - adding labels to the inputs
 - positioning in css (relative/absolute/bottom), 
 - css units (vh,vw, px), 
 - styling of input boxes,
 - styling pseudo-classes (focus)
 - including downloaded fonts, 
 - using Emmet
