          <br />
          Turmoil has engulfed the Galactic Republic. The taxation of trade
          routes to outlying star systems is in dispute. Hoping to resolve the
          matter with a blockade of deadly battleships, the greedy Trade
          Federation has stopped all shipping to the small planet of Naboo.
          While the Congress of the Republic endlessly debates this alarming
          chain of events, the Supreme Chancellor has secretly dispatched two
          Jedi Knights, the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy, to

          maintain peace and order in the galaxy. Senator Amidala, the former
          Queen of Naboo, is returning to the Galactic Senate to vote on the

          <br />It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a
          hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic

          station with enough power to destroy an entire planet. Pursued by the
          Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia races home aboard her
